The data provided in this folder were obtained from a measurement campaign in the Forl√¨ substation, Italy, as part of the European research project MYRAILS (https://myrails.it/).
The signals were originally acquired with a sampling rate of 50 kHz. In order to reduce the size of the files by favoring the transfer, the data was averaged every 1 ms. The difference in the energy calculation performed on samples at 50 kHz compared to that performed on samples at 1 kHz has been evaluated and is negligible.
However, if you need waveforms with a higher sample rate or more data from other days, please let us know.

The folder contains 24 .mat files from day 2020/10/30, one for each hour.
Each file provides:
- the busbar voltage, vb
- the current measured at busbar, ib.
